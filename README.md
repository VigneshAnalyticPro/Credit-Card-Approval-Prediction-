Abstract:
Banks receive a lot of applications for issuance of credit cards. Many of them are rejected for many reasons, like high-loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual’s credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is error-prone and a time consuming process. This task can be automated with the power of machine learning. In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

##Credit Card Approval Prediction.
Abstract:
Banks receive a lot of applications for issuance of credit cards. Many of them are rejected for many reasons, like high-loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual’s credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is error-prone and a time consuming process. This task can be automated with the power of machine learning. In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do. 
 
##Problem Statement: 
The task is to analyze and build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a credit card application should be approved or rejected based on various applicant attributes and historical credit data. The goal is to develop a model that can assist financial institutions in making informed decisions while minimizing the risk of default and maximizing profitability.
